**A development of the Casper theme for Postleaf.**

Created by [Steve Pike](https://twitter.com/oztourer)

## Development status

- Pages and posts support comments by registered users, but only where the tag 'comments-allowed' is specified for that page or post. A further tag, 'comments-closed', can be set to prevent further comments from being added to the page or post. At present neither tag is set up when the theme is installed, they need to be added manually in the admin page for tags.

## Installation

- Copy the themes/wildgeese directory to the themese directory of your [Postleaf](https://github.com/Postleaf) installation.
- Install [Postleaf](https://github.com/Postleaf) plugin [Comments](https://github.com/oztourer/Postleaf-comments) if you require comments support.

## Versioning

Postleaf is maintained under the [Semantic Versioning guidelines](http://semver.org/) and this plugin attempts to adhere to the same guidelines.
